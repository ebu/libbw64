# Changelog

## Unreleased

This version fixes a number of buffer overruns, integer overflows, and uses of uninitialised data which may be triggered by reading malformed files; all users are advised to upgrade.

### Added

- library can now easier be used as a CMake subproject
- new CMake option `BW64_PACKAGE_AND_INSTALL`

### Changed

- Renamed CMake library target name from `libbw64` to `bw64`
- Renamed CMake option `UNIT_TESTS` to `BW64_UNIT_TESTS`
- Renamed CMake option `EXAMPLES` to `BW64_EXAMPLES`
- `FormatInfoChunk::formatTag` now matches the formatTag in the file, rather than always returning 1
- fmt parsing is stricter -- the chunk size must match the use of cbSize, and the presence if extra data is checked against the formatTag

### Fixed

- Fix sample rate parameter type in `writeFile()` and `BW64Writer` ctor to support 96k samplerates
- fmt extra data is now written correctly
